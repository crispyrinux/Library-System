# Library-System
A full-stack web application that integrates a complete frontend, backend, and database system to manage and streamline the project's core operations.

# Project Description

This project is a complete web-based system built with a fully implemented frontend, backend, and database. It is designed to support the operational needs of the organization by providing an integrated platform that manages data, user interactions, and business processes efficiently.

The system includes a fully functional user interface, server-side logic, data validation, and secure data storage. All core features were developed from scratch, including the application architecture, API endpoints, UI components, and database structure. The project demonstrates practical full-stack development skills and showcases how frontend, backend, and database layers work together as a cohesive system.

Key features include:
- Fully implemented frontend with responsive and user-friendly design
- Backend API with secure and well-structured endpoints
- Database integration with proper relationships and data handling
- CRUD operations across core modules
- Authentication/authorization (if implemented)
- Input validation and error handling
- Clear project structure and scalable code architecture
- Documentation for setup, configuration, and system usage

This repository serves as a complete demonstration of full-stack development, integrating design, logic, and data management into one functional web application.
